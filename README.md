Local AI translation tool for WordPress themes &amp; plugins using Chrome's built-in Translator API.

The AI Auto Translator For WordPress Plugins is an innovative tool designed to enhance the translation capabilities of WordPress plugins and themes by utilizing local AI models and the Translator API in Chrome.

### Description

The AI Auto Translator for WordPress Plugins is an addon for the Loco Translate plugin that uses Chrome built-in AI to automatically translate all strings in a WordPress plugin or theme with just one click.

Instead of manually translating each string, users can now:

Select a plugin or theme to translate.
Choose their target language.
Click the Auto Translate button to translate all strings instantly.
The result? Translations are applied directly to your plugin or theme, saving hours of work.

### How We Built It

1. Choosing a Base Plugin:
    - We used the Loco Translate plugin as the base plugin to save development time since itâ€™s widely used for WordPress plugin and theme translations.

2. Developing the Addon:
    - We created a custom addon that integrates with Loco Translate to add an Auto Translate button.
    - This button interacts with Chromeâ€™s built-in AI to perform automatic translations.

3. Easy Workflow & Chrome AI Integration:
    - Guided users through enabling the Chrome Translator Modal and installing language packs.
    - Designed the addon to handle large datasets and ensure translations are applied efficiently.
    - Focused on creating a beginner-friendly interface.
